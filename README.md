# Forum App Web
Basic Forum, FrontEnd made in ReactJs and BackEnd in NodeJs using MongoDB

Although the project has been delivered, there are plans to improve it.

How to see it?

    1. Download/clone the repository.
    
    2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository location, 
    enter the Back folder.
    
    3. Run "npm install" in your terminal (You need mongoDb installed on your computer).
    
    4. Run "npm run dev" in your terminal.

    5. Open another terminal and navigate to the repository location, 
    enter the Front folder.

    6. Run "npm install" in your terminal.
    
    7. Run "npm run dev" in your terminal 
    (If you run the FrontEnd without the BackEnd running, the application will not work).
