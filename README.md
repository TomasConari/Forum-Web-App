# Forum Web App
Basic Forum Web App.
I'm currently working on getting it to run inside a Docker container.

Frontend technologies used:

    - Vite
    - ReactJS


Backend technologies used:

    - Node.js
    - Express
    - MongoDB


How to see it?

    1. Download/clone the repository.
    
    2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository location, 
    enter the Back folder.
    
    3. Run "npm install" in your terminal (You need mongoDb installed on your computer).
    
    4. Run "npm run dev" in your terminal.

    5. Open another terminal and navigate to the repository location, 
    enter the Front folder.

    6. Run "npm install" in your terminal.
    
    7. Run "npm run dev" in your terminal 
    (If you run the FrontEnd without the BackEnd running, the application will not work).


Project Info:

    - The application functions as a basic forum social network.
    You can create an account, log in, create posts, and view those of other users.
    
    - Despite the project has been delivered,
    I will continue to develop it and implement improvements.
